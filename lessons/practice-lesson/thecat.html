Sure, here is a story and a question with 4 answers and the correct answer:

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Alice who lived in a small town. She was a curious and adventurous girl, and she loved to explore. One day, she was walking in the woods when she came across a strange hole. She peered down the hole, but it was too dark to see anything. Alice decided to climb down the hole, and she found herself in a strange and wonderful world called Wonderland.

In Wonderland, Alice met all sorts of strange and interesting creatures, including a talking rabbit, a mad hatter, and a Cheshire cat. She had many adventures, and she learned a lot about herself and the world.

One day, Alice was walking through the forest when she came across a fork in the road. There was a signpost that said, "To the Queen's Castle" and "To the Rabbit Hole." Alice didn't know which way to go.</p>
